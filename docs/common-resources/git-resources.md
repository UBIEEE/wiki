# Git Resources

This is a list of resources that are helpful to teach yourself git. Many of these resources cover the same content, but we offer a variety of options to fit different learning styles. We recommend that everyone start from the beginning and work your way down as needed unless you have a reason to do otherwise. 

!!! note "Git && GitHub Workshop"

    The workshop slides are great to review if you have attended the workshop, but you probably will not find them helpful if you never attended in person. If you have not attended the workshop, skip the those slides.
