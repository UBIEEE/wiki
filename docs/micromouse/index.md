# MicroMouse

## About

The MicroMouse competition is one of the oldest robotics competitions in the world. The goal of the competition is to design a robot "mouse" that can autonomously navigate and solve a 16x16 cell maze as fast as possible.

Check out Veritasium's video on the MicroMouse competition to get an idea of what it's all about:

## Getting Started

This site contains general knowledge about designing, constructing, and programming MicroMouse robots.
Information here will help you build any level of MicroMouse - from simple robots designed completely from COTS parts and 3D printing, to advanced high-speed robots with custom PCBs.
