# MicroMouse 3D Printing

Almost every modern MicroMouse robot has at least a few 3D printed parts. The robot's chassis is usually 3D printed, and many robots have 3D printed wheels and gears.

We recommend using [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) for CAD work, as it is free and personal use and makes collaboration with other team members easy. Our club uses Onshape for most CAD work.

You may 3D print parts on campus in the DREAM lab at Bonner 118.
